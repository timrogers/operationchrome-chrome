Taskforce: Operation Chrome
===========================

What is the extension?
-----------------------

Taskforce: Operation Chrome is an unofficial extension for users of the beta task management application, Taskforce, which lets you view your tasks from outside of your Google Mail account. This means you can view and update your tasks and view your activity feed wherever you happen to be on the Internet, straight from your Chrome toolbar.

Taskforce is currently in beta testing, and you can find out more about it at http://www.taskforceapp.com. The official Taskforce extension is available on the [Google Chrome Extensions website](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gdbfnafnalfjconpgenohfidcaeibkoc).

It is very badly made, and I know this, but I did the best with my limited resources and knowledge. It is just an iFrame invoked by a toolbar button.

How do I install this?
----------------------

It's pretty simple to install. You just need to clone it from the git repository, then open the Extensions screen in Chrome, enable "Developer mode" amd then click "Load unpacked extension". This will also be available on the official Chrome Extensions site in due course.
